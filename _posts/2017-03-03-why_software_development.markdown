*QUESTION: Why learn software development?*

*ANSWER: ...because I wanna!*

In all honesty, I want to learn software development because I love knowing how things work fundamentally. I'm in technology/cybersecurity realm already, but I have no sense of creativity or aspects of "Art + Analytics" in my job. 

I have been a creative since childhood, and lately I feel like my "techie" job is stifling that sense of creativity that I may be missing. I feel as though software development will not only give me the leg up I need in my career, but perhaps plant me in a direction where I can do more with what I know. 

Coding also gives me a sense of empowerment in that I made it myself, it works, and others can use it.
