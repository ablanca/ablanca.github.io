I haven't quite reached deep into the curriculum just yet (life happens), but what I do recognize is that there are quite a few similarities between coding and the real world.

Case and point - problem solving, variables, and debugging.

Similar to how life has it's many challenges and several ways to respond to those challenges, coding should be approached that way as well - and with a strategy! In doing some research within the curriculum and outside, I have noticed that there are varied ways in which to write code effectivetly and efficiently. 

In order to work with what you've got to solve these challenges, you have identify and define the variables involved. In life experiences, this is almost intuitive for some, just by being empathetic and understanding the source or cause of the problem. With coding, this may require reaching back and calling some "commands" to identify what is being used. 

Then depending on the objective and expected outcome, the code can be written quick and in a hurry or complete and methodical. What ties in nicely with that observation is that if you go for the quick and dirty method, you may find yourself debugging quite a bit - similiar to life experiences. If one chooses the easier way out of a given situation, the outcome may not be as expected and may pose further challenges in the future that need to be addressed down the line/stack. (haha... get it)

So in comparing code and life, I'd have to say that in many ways ... **"efil si edoC".reverse**
